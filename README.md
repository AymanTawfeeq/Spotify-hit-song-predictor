# Spotify-hit-song-predictor


The music industry has had a huge impact on people's lives over the years. It has helped inspire people and has even been used as a coping mechanism for people who struggle with mental health. The impact of music is undeniable and it has played a critical role in today's society.  Over the decades, people's music preference has changed from different genres, such as Jazz, hip-hop, or R&B. When considering the change in mainstream music, it is clear that the factors that affect whether a song will become a hit or not seem to change over the years. These reasons motivated the decision to create a model that analyzes thousands of songs and predicts whether a song will be considered a hit or not. It will help identify factors and patterns and give a better understanding of mainstream music in the 2000s decade (2000-2009).
